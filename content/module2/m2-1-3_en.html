        <h1>Indian registration (status)</h1>
        <p>“Registered Indians” are First Nations individuals who are registered with the Government of Canada under the <em>Indian Act</em>. They are often referred to as “status Indians”, although that is not an official term.</p>
        <p><a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-11">Section 6 of the current <em>Indian Act</em></a> sets out the rules for eligibility. Eligibility for Indian status is based on an individual's descent from a person who is registered, or eligible to be registered, as an Indian. </p>
        <p>The definition of who is an “Indian” has historically been determined by the Government of Canada and not by the First Nations. Historically, First Nations individuals could lose their status:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>if they graduated from university </li>
            <li>became Christian ministers </li>
            <li>achieved professional designations as doctors or lawyers </li>
            <li>served in the military</li>
        </ul>
		<div class="special">
            <p>First Nations women and their children would lose their status if the women married men who were not First Nations. </p>

				<summary>Myth: All First Nations don’t pay taxes</summary>
				<div class="content">
					<p>A limited number of First Nations people do not pay taxes. <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-12">Sections 87 to 90 of the <em>Indian Act</em></a> state that <strong>Status Indians</strong> do not pay federal or provincial taxes on real and personal property that is on a reserve.</p>
					<p>Status Indians who work on a reserve do not pay federal or provincial taxes on income. However, <strong>any income earned off reserves is taxable</strong>.</p>
					<p>Section 87 exempts GST on the goods and services bought by Status Indians at businesses located <strong>on a reserve</strong>. <strong>Goods and services purchased off reserves by Status Indians, but delivered to the reserve, are also tax exempt</strong>. Most provincial sales taxes are applied.</p>
