    <h1>Using names respectfully</h1>
    <p>Using a person’s preferred name is a great <strong>sign of respect</strong> for the individual and their lived experiences. However, not everyone feels comfortable talking about their experiences or explaining the significance of their name. Timing and context matter when we learn about one another. This is a large part of <strong>building respectful relationships</strong>.</p>
    <p>If you were to meet T8aminik, he would be more than happy to tell you a bit about himself. You could ask him, Kapiteotak, what is the significance of your name? Or, could you please tell me a story about your upbringing as an Anicinape? These are two examples of how to respectfully ask someone about their personal stories—and Kapiteotak has many fascinating stories to tell you!</p>
