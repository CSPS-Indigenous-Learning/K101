        <p>Under the <em>Indian Act</em>, the registrar—an official from Indigenous Services Canada —is responsible for maintaining the Indian Register and has the sole authority for determining which names will be added, deleted or omitted. While registration of individuals was something experienced previously in history (e.g.: WWII for Japanese Canadians), the Government of Canada maintains this system for First Nations even today. </p>
        <p>Indian registration gives &ldquo;Status Indians&rdquo; access to certain legal rights and entitlements. This is because the Government of Canada has constitutional responsibility for “Indians”. The provinces do not provide most services on reserves. Indian status is also linked to some treaty rights, such as treaty annuity payments, and some Aboriginal rights (for example, hunting and fishing).</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Non-Status&rdquo; Indians are people who identify as First Nations but do not qualify under the criteria of the <em>Indian Act</em>. This group is not eligible for programs and services that the Government of Canada has developed for Status Indians. However, they are often recognized as members of First Nations communities.</p>
