		<h2>First Nations or Indians?</h2>
        <h3>Let’s look at the terminology</h3>
        <p>You may have learned in school that early European explorers called the people they encountered “Indians” because they mistakenly believed that <strong>North America</strong> was India. This story may or may not be true, but the term “Indian” stuck. It was commonly used to refer to Indigenous populations until the 1970s.</p>
        <p>Some Indigenous peoples in Canada chose the term &ldquo;<strong>First Nation</strong>&rdquo; as a way to refer to themselves. It is used today by government and the public as a more respectful term than &ldquo;Indian.&rdquo; Although it is widely used, no legal definition of “First Nation” exists.</p>
		<p>In this course, we use “First Nation” rather than “Indian,” except in historical or legal references.</p>
