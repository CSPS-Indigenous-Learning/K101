        <p>The <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-8"><em>Indian Act</em></a> was introduced in 1876. The Government of Canada used this legislation to administer Indian status, local First Nations governments and the management of reserve land and communal monies. Today, the <em>Indian Act</em> applies only to First Nations and Status Indians. It does not apply to Non-Status Indians, Métis or Inuit.</p>
        <p>As Sir John A. MacDonald tells us, the <em>Indian Act</em> was never intended to protect the culture, language or beliefs of “Indian people.” In effect, it has enabled human rights violations, trauma and social, cultural and political disruption for generations of First Nations peoples.</p>
