        <p>Finally, here’s what you need to remember from this course:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There are more than 600 diverse and unique First Nations communities across Canada</li>
            <li>Colonization continues to impact current realities</li>
            <li>Historic treaties are part of the Constitution of Canada and must be respected today</li>
        </ul>
        <p>First Nations are the predominant Indigenous group in Canada, but we can’t forget the Métis and the Inuit. We invite you to learn more about these Indigenous peoples in the next courses.</p>
