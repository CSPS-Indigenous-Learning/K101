        <h1>Indian agents</h1>
        <p>Indian agents were non-Indigenous government officials who implemented the federal Indian policy. They were the Government of Canada’s representatives on reserves. Their main goal was to assimilate the “Indians” and solve the “Indian problem.” Under the <em>Indian Act</em> of 1876, the Indian agent held a position of <strong>power</strong> and had the ability to dictate how First Nations people lived. </p>
        <p>Indian Agents could:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>act as judges, property surveyors, administrators, lawmakers and police </li>
            <li>enforce attendance at Indian Residential Schools </li>
            <li>control religious and cultural practices that the state deemed “uncivilized”</li>
            <li>decide how food rations were distributed and determine who was in need of assistance</li>
        </ul>

            <p class="bold">The Indian Department was first created in 1755 to manage military alliances. Over time, it grew into the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs, managing not only Canada's relationship with First Nations, Inuit and Métis, but also all of Canada’s North. </p>
            <p class="bold">In August 2017, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced plans for the dissolution of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) and the creation of two new departments: Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) and Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada (CIRNAC). These two departments will continue to evolve to meet the needs and challenges faced by Indigenous peoples in Canada.</p>

        <h1>The pass system</h1>
		<p>The 1996 <em>Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (RCAP)</em> tells us that in 1885, in response to the events of the <a href="#glossaryRedRiverResistance" class="csps-glossary" data-effect="mfp-zoom-in">Red River Resistance</a>, the Department of Indian Affairs instituted a pass system. No outsider could come onto a reserve to do business with an Aboriginal resident without permission from the Indian agent.</p>
        <p>The report goes on to say that in many places, the directives were interpreted to mean that no Aboriginal person could leave the reserve without permission from the Indian agent. Reserves began to resemble prisons.</p>
