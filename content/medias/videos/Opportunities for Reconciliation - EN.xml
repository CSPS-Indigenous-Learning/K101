         <p begin="00:00:26.41" end="00:00:28.75">Reconciliation is a national project.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:28.75" end="00:00:31.12">This is part of ensuring that Canada</p>
         <p begin="00:00:31.12" end="00:00:32.95">is a fair and inclusive country.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:35.25" end="00:00:37.79">It means learning about our history,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:37.79" end="00:00:39.95">learning about what we have gone through.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:39.95" end="00:00:42.29">It is very important for people to learn about it</p>
         <p begin="00:00:42.29" end="00:00:43.95">so that people get a sense of our history</p>
         <p begin="00:00:43.95" end="00:00:46.37">because we are not in the Canadian history books.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:48.45" end="00:00:51.62">To me, reconciliation starts with me.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:51.62" end="00:00:57.87">Our history is not as peaceful, as graceful, as I was taught.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:57.87" end="00:00:61.66">I need to recognize that I don&apos;t know everything</p>
         <p begin="00:00:61.66" end="00:00:63.29">and I am ready to learn.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:67.00" end="00:00:70.12">The opportunities for reconciliation are everywhere.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:72.45" end="00:00:75.20">We are a huge instrument of public governance</p>
         <p begin="00:00:75.20" end="00:00:78.62">in this country, and so it is especially important for us</p>
         <p begin="00:00:78.62" end="00:00:81.54">to find a way that we can translate concepts like</p>
         <p begin="00:00:81.54" end="00:00:85.79">reconciliation into practical, meaningful change on the ground</p>
         <p begin="00:00:85.79" end="00:00:87.33">in the lives of Indigenous peoples.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:87.33" end="00:00:89.62">This is not a scary concept.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:89.62" end="00:00:92.75">It is not an incantation for political purposes.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:92.75" end="00:00:96.04">This is truly about our mission to help build a better Canada.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:98.00" end="00:00:100.79">It is about developing that knowledge</p>
         <p begin="00:00:100.79" end="00:00:102.87">of what our history was.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:102.87" end="00:00:105.25">We took away cultural identities from people.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:105.25" end="00:00:110.08">We promoted these types of soul wounds, and we didn&apos;t allow them</p>
         <p begin="00:00:110.08" end="00:00:114.91">the space to be and to identify with who they are as people.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:114.91" end="00:00:117.00">We didn&apos;t encourage their language.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:117.00" end="00:00:119.50">We didn&apos;t encourage their cultural ways.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:121.45" end="00:00:124.54">Our early history is not solid.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:124.54" end="00:00:128.29">It is a dark history, and we are still trying</p>
         <p begin="00:00:128.29" end="00:00:133.45">to move past some of the actions that we took over 100 years ago.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:140.50" end="00:00:142.25">Sessions like this are really important,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:142.25" end="00:00:144.33">particularly at the executive level.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:144.33" end="00:00:147.70">A conference like this, with executives in</p>
         <p begin="00:00:147.70" end="00:00:150.75">the public service, is really critical to have</p>
         <p begin="00:00:150.75" end="00:00:152.50">a session on reconciliation.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:152.50" end="00:00:155.41">The commitment is exemplified from the top.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:155.41" end="00:00:158.33">It has a ripple effect throughout the sector</p>
         <p begin="00:00:158.33" end="00:00:161.16">through the department, throughout public service.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:166.37" end="00:00:167.95">I am hoping that, through these sessions,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:167.95" end="00:00:170.25">people will learn about who we are.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:160.25" end="00:00:172.20">Hopefully people will take an interest,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:172.20" end="00:00:174.62">not just because it is their job and because these are</p>
         <p begin="00:00:174.62" end="00:00:176.83">people&apos;s lives that we are dealing with.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:176.83" end="00:00:179.70">I hope they take it out of interest and also for</p>
         <p begin="00:00:179.70" end="00:00:183.54">their professional development, so that they can make</p>
         <p begin="00:00:183.54" end="00:00:186.91">a better informed decision on behalf of the people they serve.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:191.79" end="00:00:195.08">The Indigenous identity is one of the distinguishing features</p>
         <p begin="00:00:195.08" end="00:00:197.16">that makes us Canadians.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:197.16" end="00:00:200.62">It is hard-wired into our history as Canada.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:200.62" end="00:00:203.20">So I think it is important that each of us takes</p>
         <p begin="00:00:203.20" end="00:00:207.00">personal responsibility to learn about our own history,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:207.00" end="00:00:209.62">to acknowledge the place that Indigenous people</p>
         <p begin="00:00:209.62" end="00:00:212.54">have had in the past, but even more important,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:212.54" end="00:00:215.08">who they are today and what place they will have</p>
         <p begin="00:00:215.08" end="00:00:215.95">going forward.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:215.95" end="00:00:219.66">I am hoping that we have developed a relationship</p>
         <p begin="00:00:219.66" end="00:00:221.66">where there is mutual respect.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:221.66" end="00:00:225.16">We cannot expect it to be within a day,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:225.16" end="00:00:227.12">within a week, within a month.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:227.12" end="00:00:230.25">It is something that we have to work on, on a daily basis.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:230.25" end="00:00:234.29">It is not one department&apos;s job. It is not one individual&apos;s job.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:234.29" end="00:00:236.70">Reconciliation is going to be all of our jobs.</p>
