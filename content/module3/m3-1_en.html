        <p>When the <em>Indian Act</em> was introduced, the existing governance structures were forcibly replaced with an imposed governance called the <strong><em>Indian Band Election Regulations</em></strong>. In some cases, the Government of Canada with the military and traders appointed chiefs that reinforced the leadership of the men they liked to work with.</p>
        <p>Today, the majority of First Nations governments are composed of a chief and councillors, who are responsible for making decisions on behalf of the First Nations community.</p>
    </section>
	<section class="col-md-4">
		<p>The selection of the chief and councillors is held in one of four ways:</p>
        <ul class="timeline-list marginBottomMobile">
            <li>following the steps outlined in the <em><a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-8">Indian Act</a></em> and the <em><a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-14">Indian Band Election Regulations</a></em></li>
            <li>using the new <em><a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-15">First Nations Elections Act</a></em>, which is optional</li>
            <li>according to a community's constitution as part of a self-government agreement</li>
            <li>using a community leadership selection process (also called &ldquo;band custom&rdquo;)</li>
