        <p>Historic treaties existed prior to Confederation or were signed between 1867 and 1921.</p>
        <p>It may surprise you to learn that not all of Canada is under some type of treaty. As of 1921, only about 50% of Canada was considered to be under a treaty. Between 1921 and 1975, no new treaties were signed.</p>
        <p>Unlike modern-day treaties, which are <strong>in-depth legal documents</strong> with provisions to stay current, pre-1975 treaties have been treated as frozen in the time they were first signed. </p>
        <h2>Provision of support</h2>
        <p>Many of the <strong>numbered treaties</strong> signed after Confederation included provisions for the Government of Canada to give First Nations support, such as access to education, ammunition and money. Most of the monetary requirements were set at $4.00 to $25.00 per person.</p>
        <p>While the monetary value of these requirements has not increased, the support remains significant to First Nations. Treaties are celebrated annually in what are often referred to as <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-16">Treaty Days</a>.</p>
