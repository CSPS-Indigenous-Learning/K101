        <h1>Unceded and unsurrendered territory</h1>
        <p>Where there is no treaty, the land is often referred to as <strong>unceded</strong> and <strong>unsurrendered</strong> territory. This means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>title of the land rests with the First Nations who come from that land</li>
            <li>Canadaâ€™s claim on the land is ambiguous and often contentious</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="special" style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
            <p>Much of Quebec and British Columbia are unceded and unsurrendered territory.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The Courts in Canada have continually recognized that <strong>Indigenous groups retain rights and titles</strong> on the land where they have resided from time immemorial. Ongoing negotiations have gone on for decades with no end in sight. This is very costly for the Government of Canada and Canadians.</p>
