        <h2>Traditional governance</h2>
        <p>Strong Indigenous societies and governance structures existed before the arrival of Europeans. These structures were based on the family, the clan, the nation and the tribe.</p>
        <p>Leaders were chosen in various ways by people who had great respect for their leadership qualities. Frequently, a council of Elders would provide advice to the leaders, and decisions were made by consensus.</p>
        <p>First Nations recognized each other as independent nations and made treaties or military alliances with each other. Some nations were traditional enemies, and they went through periods of war and peace.</p>
        <p>Given the variety of cultures and languages among First Nations, Europeans found it difficult to understand or appreciate their differing governing structures. They often gave names to positions that equated to something they could understand.</p>
        <p>The term &ldquo;<strong>Chief</strong>,&rdquo; for example, greatly simplifies the political structure that existed and continues to exist among First Nations. However, it allowed European settlers to identify a male spokesperson to negotiate with, diminishing the roles of Elders and women.</p>

				<summary>Haudenosaunee Confederacy</summary>
				<p>The <strong>Haudenosaunee Confederacy</strong> was made up of a number of independent Iroquois nations who came together under the “Great Law of Peace.” Elected representatives from each nation would meet to discuss their challenges and work together to avoid misunderstandings and war.</p>
        		<p><strong>Does this sound familiar? </strong>In fact, the Haudenosaunee Confederacy was one model of governance that inspired the political systems developing in the United States and Canada in the 18th century. Other confederacy systems existed as well—the Huron-Wendat Confederacy in Southern Ontario, the Blackfoot Confederacy in the Great Plains and the Coastal Salish in British Columbia, to name a few.</p>

				<summary>Clan-society systems</summary>
				<p>At the local level, clan-society systems existed in which individuals belonged to a group that determined the individual’s role in the community. Each individual had a specific role to play for the social benefit of all. The <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-13">Kaska Dena</a> in the Yukon had the following clan structure:</p>
        		<p>Most Kaska also belonged to one of two moieties (kinship groups or clans) — Wolf and Raven (crow). These moieties were matrilineal, meaning that ancestry was traced through the female line (e.g., if a mother belonged to the Wolf moiety, her children were also Wolf members). Kaska moieties were also exogamous, meaning that a member of the Raven group could not marry another Raven; the same is true for the Wolf. (Pedersen and Clark 2011)</p>
