        <p>Starting in 1975 a new era of treaty making began. As mentioned in course 2, treaties during this period can be called comprehensive land claims or modern treaties. These treaties deal with the unfinished business of treaty making in Canada.</p>

		<p>Since 1973, the Government of Canada and its negotiation partners have signed 26 comprehensive land claims and 4 self-government agreements. Of the 26 signed agreements, 18 include provisions related to self-government.</p>
        <p>Not all First Nations or their traditional lands have a treaty—even today.</p>
        <h2>Broken promises</h2>
        <p>A treaty remains alive and needs to be respected—regardless of when it was signed. Every treaty contains details of obligations and entitlements for both parties signing it. A treaty should never be thought of as a simple contract of selling land to the Crown.</p>
        <p>Over the years, the Crown’s <strong>obligations</strong> have often gone <strong>unfulfilled</strong>. Whenever this happens—whether through neglect, oversight or bad faith—many First Nations and their people suffer.</p>
        <p>The Government of Canada has a process in place for addressing unfulfilled promises called &ldquo;specific claims.&rdquo; The <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-17">specific claims</a> process has proven to be demanding and painful. It has frequently resulted in Canada needing to redress past wrongs.</p>

            <p>Treaty obligations remain today and are guaranteed and protected by the Constitution.</p>
