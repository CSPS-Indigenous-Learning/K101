        <p>Under the 1876 <em>Indian Act</em>, the reserve system set aside a “piece of land, the legal title to which is vested in Her Majesty that has been set apart by Her Majesty for the use and benefit of a band.”</p>
        <p>Historically, this has meant that <strong>First Nations had land set aside to live on</strong>, but ownership and control of the land remained with the Government of Canada. The reserve system served as an effective way to control First Nations peoples and their land. </p>
        <p>First Nations reserves are located throughout Canada. For detailed information about them and First Nations communities today, see the <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-10">First Nation Profiles Interactive Map</a>.</p>
