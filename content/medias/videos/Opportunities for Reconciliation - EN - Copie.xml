         <p begin="00:00:17.41" end="00:00:19.75">Reconciliation is a national project.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:19.75" end="00:00:22.12">This is part of ensuring that Canada</p>
         <p begin="00:00:22.12" end="00:00:23.95">is a fair and inclusive country.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:26.25" end="00:00:28.79">It means learning about our history,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:28.79" end="00:00:30.95">learning about what we have gone through.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:30.95" end="00:00:33.29">It is very important for people to learn about it</p>
         <p begin="00:00:33.29" end="00:00:34.95">so that people get a sense of our history</p>
         <p begin="00:00:34.95" end="00:00:37.37">because we are not in the Canadian history books.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:39.45" end="00:00:42.62">To me, reconciliation starts with me.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:42.62" end="00:00:48.87">Our history is not as peaceful, as graceful, as I was taught.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:48.87" end="00:00:52.66">I need to recognize that I don&apos;t know everything</p>
         <p begin="00:00:52.66" end="00:00:54.29">and I am ready to learn.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:58.00" end="00:00:61.12">The opportunities for reconciliation are everywhere.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:63.45" end="00:00:66.20">We are a huge instrument of public governance</p>
         <p begin="00:00:66.20" end="00:00:69.62">in this country, and so it is especially important for us</p>
         <p begin="00:00:69.62" end="00:00:72.54">to find a way that we can translate concepts like</p>
         <p begin="00:00:72.54" end="00:00:76.79">reconciliation into practical, meaningful change on the ground</p>
         <p begin="00:00:76.79" end="00:00:78.33">in the lives of Indigenous peoples.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:78.33" end="00:00:80.62">This is not a scary concept.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:80.62" end="00:00:83.75">It is not an incantation for political purposes.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:83.75" end="00:00:87.04">This is truly about our mission to help build a better Canada.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:89.00" end="00:00:91.79">It is about developing that knowledge</p>
         <p begin="00:00:91.79" end="00:00:93.87">of what our history was.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:93.87" end="00:00:96.25">We took away cultural identities from people.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:96.25" end="00:00:101.08">We promoted these types of soul wounds, and we didn&apos;t allow them</p>
         <p begin="00:00:101.08" end="00:00:105.91">the space to be and to identify with who they are as people.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:105.91" end="00:00:108.00">We didn&apos;t encourage their language.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:108.00" end="00:00:110.50">We didn&apos;t encourage their cultural ways.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:112.45" end="00:00:115.54">Our early history is not solid.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:115.54" end="00:00:119.29">It is a dark history, and we are still trying</p>
         <p begin="00:00:119.29" end="00:00:124.45">to move past some of the actions that we took over 100 years ago.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:131.50" end="00:00:133.25">Sessions like this are really important,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:133.25" end="00:00:135.33">particularly at the executive level.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:135.33" end="00:00:138.70">A conference like this, with executives in</p>
         <p begin="00:00:138.70" end="00:00:141.75">the public service, is really critical to have</p>
         <p begin="00:00:141.75" end="00:00:143.50">a session on reconciliation.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:143.50" end="00:00:146.41">The commitment is exemplified from the top.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:146.41" end="00:00:149.33">It has a ripple effect throughout the sector</p>
         <p begin="00:00:149.33" end="00:00:152.16">through the department, throughout public service.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:157.37" end="00:00:158.95">I am hoping that, through these sessions,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:158.95" end="00:00:161.25">people will learn about who we are.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:161.25" end="00:00:163.20">Hopefully people will take an interest,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:163.20" end="00:00:165.62">not just because it is their job and because these are</p>
         <p begin="00:00:165.62" end="00:00:167.83">people&apos;s lives that we are dealing with.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:167.83" end="00:00:170.70">I hope they take it out of interest and also for</p>
         <p begin="00:00:170.70" end="00:00:174.54">their professional development, so that they can make</p>
         <p begin="00:00:174.54" end="00:00:177.91">a better informed decision on behalf of the people they serve.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:182.79" end="00:00:186.08">The Indigenous identity is one of the distinguishing features</p>
         <p begin="00:00:186.08" end="00:00:188.16">that makes us Canadians.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:188.16" end="00:00:191.62">It is hard-wired into our history as Canada.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:191.62" end="00:00:194.20">So I think it is important that each of us takes</p>
         <p begin="00:00:194.20" end="00:00:198.00">personal responsibility to learn about our own history,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:198.00" end="00:00:200.62">to acknowledge the place that Indigenous people</p>
         <p begin="00:00:200.62" end="00:00:203.54">have had in the past, but even more important,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:203.54" end="00:00:206.08">who they are today and what place they will have</p>
         <p begin="00:00:206.08" end="00:00:206.95">going forward.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:206.95" end="00:00:210.66">I am hoping that we have developed a relationship</p>
         <p begin="00:00:210.66" end="00:00:212.66">where there is mutual respect.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:212.66" end="00:00:216.16">We cannot expect it to be within a day,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:216.16" end="00:00:218.12">within a week, within a month.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:218.12" end="00:00:221.25">It is something that we have to work on, on a daily basis.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:221.25" end="00:00:225.29">It is not one department&apos;s job. It is not one individual&apos;s job.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:225.29" end="00:00:227.70">Reconciliation is going to be all of our jobs.</p>
