				<div class="tgl-panel">
					<div class="col-md-10 vcenter">
						<p>The low income of First Nations people in various communities can be linked to government policies that created barriers to economic development and investment. Until recently, for example, First Nations were prohibited under the <em>Indian Act</em> from selling agricultural produce. Barriers to education and employment have also created significant negative impacts.</p>

				<div class="tgl-panel">
					<div class="col-md-10 vcenter">
						<p>Between 2004 and 2014, two thirds of First Nations people in Canada lived under at least one <strong>water advisory</strong> (a public health notice that the water is contaminated). In Ontario, experts reported that 90% of the population of Grassy Narrows and Wabaseemoong First Nations were exposed to mercury from the Wabigoon–English River system. In 2017, the river was still contaminated.</p>

					<div class="col-md-10 vcenter">
						<p>In 2011, the Government of Canada evaluated the state of First Nations <strong>housing</strong>. It found that 41.5% of on-reserve households required major renovations. Mould, insect infestations, inadequate heating and contaminated water were just some of the concerns.</p>

				<summary>Suicide</summary>
				<div class="tgl-panel">
					<div class="col-md-12 vcenter">
						<p>Suicide among First Nations youth is 5 to 7 times higher than for non-Indigenous youth. High rates of suicide are related to complex social factors that exist outside the individual’s control. They include poverty, underemployment and social isolation. As well, high rates of suicide are linked to the impacts of historical and ongoing colonization. </p>
						<p>Indian Residential Schools and the resulting effects of <a href="#glossaryIntergenerationalTrauma" class="csps-glossary" data-effect="mfp-zoom-in">intergenerational trauma</a> have specifically impacted First Nations suicide rates. The risks associated with attending an Indian Residential School not only impact the individual—they accumulate across generations. Evidence shows that a First Nations youth whose parents or grandparents attended Indian Residential Schools is more likely to experience depression and suicidal thoughts that may lead to the suicide attempts.</p>

				<summary>Child welfare system</summary>
				<div class="tgl-panel">
					<div class="col-md-10 vcenter">
						<p>The over-representation of Indigenous children in the child welfare system is a disturbing illustration of intergenerational trauma and the impacts of colonization and racism. Exact numbers can be difficult to determine because:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>not all families or children self-identify as Indigenous </li>
							<li>sometimes the question of identity is not asked </li>
						</ul>
						<p>That said, is clear that Indigenous children make up a disproportionate number in the child welfare system. First Nations children are estimated to be 2 to 3 times more likely to be in care. </p>
						<p>Service delivery, programs and policies must be built on the strength and resilience of Indigenous peoples and their communities. They must also address the systemic reasons for the over-representation of Indigenous children in the child welfare system. </p>

				<summary>Justice</summary>
				<div class="tgl-panel">
					<div class="col-md-10 vcenter">
						<p>Indigenous peoples are overrepresented in the <strong>justice system</strong>. Research has shown that the high crime rate in the Indigenous population is a result of the effects of residential schools. In 1996, the <em>Criminal Code</em> was amended to allow judges to examine alternatives to imprisonment.</p>
						<p>A more holistic approach is now taken to rehabilitate and reintegrate Indigenous offenders that includes traditional practices, such as healing lodges and circles and access to Elders. </p>
