        <p>Before the Europeans arrived, First Nations had agreements among themselves over access to land and resources and the conduct of trade. Treaty making was a serious and solemn process. The completion of treaties involved ceremonies and took on a sacred meaning within society. When Europeans arrived on Turtle Island, First Nations continued a practice they were familiar with.</p>
        <h2>Wampum belts</h2>
        <p><a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-18">Wampum belts</a> were used in treaty making by many First Nations in the northeastern part of the country to signify peaceful intent or the importance of a message. For example, the Two Row Wampum Belt (Kaswehntha) was created by the Haudenosaunee and used over 400 years ago in dealings with the first newcomers.</p>
		<p>The Two Row Wampum Belt embodies peace, friendship and the river of life. The two rows of purple beads represent two journeysâ€”the Haudenosaunee travelling in their canoe with their customs and laws and the Europeans travelling along a parallel path in their ship. Neither was to try to steer the other's vessel, or interfere with their journey.</p>
