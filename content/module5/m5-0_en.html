				<h3>Recognition, Respect, Relationships, Reconciliation - The Path of Reconciliation</h3>
				<p>On May 30, 2016, executives of the Public Service of Canada met to talk about reconciliation</p>
                <p><strong>Micheal Hudson - Lead, Task force on Constitutional Relations with Indigenous Nations, Justice Canada:</strong> Reconciliation is a national project. This is part of ensuring that Canada is a fair and inclusive country.</p>
                <p><strong>Henry Kudluk - Aboriginal Awareness Officer, Learning and Well Being Directorate, Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC):</strong> It means learning about our history, learning about what we have gone through. It is very important for people to learn about it so that people get a sense of our history because we are not in the Canadian history books. </p>
                <p><strong>Nadia Ferrara, Phd - Senior Advisor, Office of the Senior Assistant Deputy Minister, Regional Operations Sector, Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC):</strong> To me, reconciliation starts with me. Our history is not as peaceful, as graceful, as I was taught. I need to recognize that I don’t know everything and I am ready to learn.</p>
                <p>The opportunities for reconciliation are everywhere.</p>
                <p><strong>Micheal Hudson:</strong> We are a huge instrument of public governance in this country, and so it is especially important for us to find a way that we can translate concepts like reconciliation into practical, meaningful change on the ground in the lives of Indigenous peoples. This is not a scary concept.</p>
                <p>It is not an incantation for political purposes. This is truly about our mission to help build a better Canada.</p>
                <p><strong>Nadia Ferrara, Phd:</strong> It is about developing that knowledge of what our history was. We took away cultural identities from people. We promoted these types of soul wounds, and we didn’t allow them the space to be and to identify with who they are as people. We didn’t encourage their language. We didn’t encourage their cultural ways.</p>
                <p><strong>Rob Prosper - Vice-President, Protected Area Establishment and Conservation, Parks Canada:</strong> Our early history is not solid. It is a dark history, and we are still trying to move past some of the actions that we took over 100 years ago.</p>
                <p>Sessions like this are really important, particularly at the executive level.</p>
                <p><strong>Nadia Ferrara, Phd:</strong> A conference like this, with executives in the public service, is really critical to have a session on reconciliation. The commitment is exemplified from the top. It has a ripple effect throughout the sector through the department, throughout public service.</p>
                <p><strong>Henry Kudluk:</strong> I am hoping that, through these sessions, people will learn about who we are. Hopefully people will take an interest, not just because it is their job and because these are people’s lives that we are dealing with. I hope they take it out of interest and also for their professional development, so that they can make a better informed decision on behalf of the people they serve.</p>
                <p><strong>Micheal Hudson:</strong> The Indigenous identity is one of the distinguishing features that makes us Canadians. It is hard-wired into our history as Canada. So I think it is important that each of us takes personal responsibility to learn about our own history, to acknowledge the place that Indigenous people have had in the past, but even more important, who they are today and what place they will have going forward.</p>
                <p><strong>Henry Kudluk:</strong> I am hoping that we have developed a relationship where there is mutual respect.</p>
                <p><strong>Nadia Ferrara, Phd:</strong> We cannot expect it to be within a day, within a week, within a month. It is something that we have to work on, on a daily basis.
                </p>
				<p><strong>Rob Prosper:</strong> It is not one department’s job. It is not one individual’s job. Reconciliation is going to be all of our jobs.</p>
