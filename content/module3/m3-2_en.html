        <p>Over time, some First Nations have re-established their governance structures to follow more traditional ways such as the hereditary lineage of chiefs. Under self-governance agreements, First Nations can establish their own laws and policies on a broad range of community matters according to their cultures and traditions.</p>
        <div class="quote-box" style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 40px;">
            <p>A self-governance agreement is created when a First Nation signs a new treaty with the Government of Canada. Self-governance agreements do not fall under the <em>Indian Act</em>.</p>

        <p>Self-governing First Nations select their own leaders and governing structures. They elect their leaders through individual election processes that vary depending on the First Nation. These processes are often unique to the specific community.</p>
